As I’m ending my web posts on my website, I’d like to thank Python for my
amazing childhood and say my last goodbye. I still remember those times when
Python2 was not that popular and nobody cared about Python when I did. Python,
you were amazing, I loved you, but the new generation destroyed you… I gonna
miss ya. Rest in peace…
